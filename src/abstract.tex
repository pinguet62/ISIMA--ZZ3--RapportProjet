Years after years we observe that time and comfort are among the most important resources
we are willing to obtain. For us, doing this project was all about gaining these precious
resources and making our project customers life more comfortable.

This work consists in using a new way of communicating while using these two previous concept. 
Indeed we are willing to take advantage of the cellphones high availability with the convenience 
of computer communication.

So how could we meet these two conditions in order to offer a comfortable and fast way of communication ?
We simply chose to create a software allowing us to send and receive SMS from a computer.
\\


The project realisation has been done in few steps. First, we have been studying many communication protocol
we wanted to use. With this analysis, we were able to choose the technologies which could overcome our main constraints.
After that, we have been designing a global scheme representating our project allowing us to estimate
each distinct part of the work to  do. Finally, we had to established two systems of communication.
The first one permits the message to be shared between the cellphone and whatsoever entity running
on the internet. The second one forwards the same message from the entity to the user. This study
over, we actually started to write programs and try to make this project possible on multiple
mobile platform (Android and iOS).
\\


This project have been done in time and is now entirely functional. Results are conclusive,
we indeed have a project that allows us to send SMS from a website. Nonetheless, to be able 
to run correctly the software, we need to modify the behaviour of the cellphone used. In fact,
it appears that it was impossible to overcome some of the constraints imposed by the various
cellphone operating systems we worked on. 

Even though, the system usually provides several tools to build applications, we notified huge
politicy difference beetween the providers. Depending on the plateform, constraints will indeed
become more important and prevent the developer from thinking outside the box.
Cellphone using iOS are clearly representating this policy. For our project, despite our success in
making this project a reality, we really had difficult time trying to bypass the unique iOS way of doing things.

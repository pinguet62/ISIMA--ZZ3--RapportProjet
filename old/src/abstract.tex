During my ISIMA second year studies, my work placement's aim was to build a virtualization solution in order to run scientific tools only available under Linux.
\\



I have first built and configured a full Linux virtual machine, on which my first solution will be based.
Its full development environment will compile scientific tools.

In analyzing the different techniques that could exist and be usable, I could turn towards the solutions I will use.
I have to think about the most practical solution for users but also for its development in the firm.

It will be necessary to improve the different remaining problems once the programs are developed and tests are performed. 
Then, a new minimal virtual machine that will offer better performance could be built.
